# OKC Thunder Schedule Analysis
OKC Thunder Schedule Analysis Project | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, sklearn
(August 2025)

- Completed a data analysis project analyzing scheduling in the NBA for the 2025 NBA champions, the OKC Thunder, as part of their recruiting process.

- Used Pandas to analyze CSV files and determine data such as how well an opponent shot (in eFG%) against OKC after playing consecutive games.

- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends such as the league-wide number of back-to-back games with travel in between from 2015–2025.

- Used Plotly to interactively visualize OKC and Denver’s respective 2024–25 schedules with a focus on scheduling density and travel distance.

- Used sklearn to create a linear regression model predicting the total number of extra wins or losses that each NBA team obtained due to scheduling factors from 2015–2025.
